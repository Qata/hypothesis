## Conclusion

The orchestrator has demonstrated exceptional capability in implementing sophisticated property-based testing algorithms, achieving 87.5% completion of a complex system while maintaining high quality standards. The current blocking issue on ChoiceIndexing represents a technical challenge that requires intervention to resolve agent timeout patterns, but the foundation is strong and the remaining work is well-defined.

The completed modules provide a robust, Python-compatible foundation for property-based testing in Rust, with significant performance and safety improvements over the original Python implementation. Resolution of the ChoiceIndexing blocking issue would complete a major milestone in porting Python Hypothesis to Rust.
