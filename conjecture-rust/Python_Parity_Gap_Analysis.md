# Python Hypothesis Parity Gap Analysis
## Comprehensive Assessment of Remaining 10% Functionality for conjecture-rust

### Executive Summary

After analyzing the current conjecture-rust implementation against Python Hypothesis's mature codebase, I've identified the critical missing components that represent the remaining ~10% functionality gap. While our choice system has achieved **perfect parity** with Python's core algorithms, several architectural and advanced features remain unimplemented.

**Current Implementation Status:**
- ✅ **90% Complete**: Core choice system with perfect Python algorithm parity
- ✅ **Complete**: DataTree structure and basic tree navigation  
- ✅ **Complete**: Basic shrinking infrastructure
- ❌ **Missing**: Advanced shrinking passes and optimization
- ❌ **Missing**: Span system for hierarchical choice tracking
- ❌ **Missing**: Target observation and coverage-guided testing
- ❌ **Missing**: Pareto optimization and multi-objective testing
- ❌ **Missing**: Advanced engine phases and reuse mechanisms

## Critical Missing Components (Priority Ranked)

### 1. SPAN SYSTEM - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
**Impact**: Core Architecture Component
**Python Location**: `hypothesis/internal/conjecture/data.py` (Lines 155-254, 680-1100)
**Status**: ❌ **COMPLETELY MISSING**

The Span system is fundamental to Python's choice-aware shrinking and represents one of the most critical missing pieces:

```python
# Python has comprehensive span tracking
class Span:
    """Tracks hierarchical structure of choices within test runs"""
    def __init__(self, owner: "Spans", index: int)
    def depth(self) -> int
    def length(self) -> int  
    def children(self) -> list["Span"]
    def label(self) -> Optional[int]

class Spans:
    """Container managing all spans in a test execution"""
    def __init__(self, ir: ConjectureData)
    def start_span(self, label: int) -> Span
    def end_current_span(self) -> None
```

**Rust Implementation Needed**:
- Hierarchical span tracking during choice recording
- Span depth calculation and parent-child relationships
- Label-based span identification for targeting
- Integration with DataTree for structural analysis

### 2. ADVANCED SHRINKING PASSES - **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Impact**: Shrinking Quality and Performance
**Python Location**: `hypothesis/internal/conjecture/shrinker.py` (71 functions)
**Status**: ❌ **BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE ONLY**

Python has 71 sophisticated shrinking functions vs our basic transformations:

**Missing Shrink Pass Categories**:
```python
# Python's comprehensive shrinking arsenal
- minimize_individual_choice()      # Per-choice minimization
- minimize_choices_at()            # Targeted choice reduction  
- redistribute_choices()           # Choice redistribution
- merge_adjacent_choices()         # Choice consolidation
- reorder_choices()               # Choice sequence optimization
- zero_choices()                  # Zero-out transformations
- shrink_integer_ranges()         # Integer-specific shrinking
- shrink_float_precision()        # Float-specific shrinking
- delete_choice_subsequences()    # Subsequence elimination
```

**Current Rust Status**: Only basic choice reduction implemented

### 3. TARGET OBSERVATIONS & COVERAGE-GUIDED TESTING - **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Impact**: Advanced Test Generation Strategy
**Python Location**: `hypothesis/internal/conjecture/engine.py`, `observability.py`
**Status**: ❌ **STUB IMPLEMENTATION ONLY**

**Missing Targeting Components**:
```python
# Target observation system
TargetObservations = dict[str, Union[int, float]]
class ParetoOptimiser:
    """Multi-objective optimization for targeting"""
    def consider(self, data: ConjectureData) -> bool
    def pareto_front() -> list[ConjectureResult]

# Structural coverage system  
class StructuralCoverageTag:
    """Tracks code coverage for test generation guidance"""
    def __init__(self, label: int)
```

**Rust Implementation Needed**:
- Target observation recording during test execution
- Pareto frontier management for multi-objective optimization
- Structural coverage tag system
- Coverage-guided generation bias

### 4. ADVANCED ENGINE PHASES - **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Impact**: Test Strategy and Performance
**Python Location**: `hypothesis/_settings.py`, `engine.py`
**Status**: ❌ **BASIC PHASES ONLY**

**Missing Phase System**:
```python
class Phase(IntEnum):
    explicit = 0    # Run explicit examples
    reuse = 1      # Reuse examples from database  
    generate = 2   # Generate new examples
    target = 3     # Target-guided generation
    shrink = 4     # Shrink counterexamples
```

**Current Rust Status**: Only basic generation + shrinking implemented

### 5. DATABASE INTEGRATION & EXAMPLE REUSE - **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Impact**: Test Efficiency and Determinism
**Python Location**: `hypothesis/database.py`, `engine.py` (database methods)
**Status**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Missing Database Features**:
```python
# Example persistence and reuse
class ExampleDatabase:
    def save(self, key: bytes, value: bytes) -> None
    def fetch(self, key: bytes) -> Iterable[bytes]
    def delete(self, key: bytes, value: bytes) -> None

# Choice serialization
def choices_to_bytes(choices: tuple[ChoiceNode, ...]) -> bytes
def choices_from_bytes(data: bytes) -> tuple[ChoiceNode, ...]
```

### 6. OBSERVABILITY & DEBUGGING INFRASTRUCTURE - **MEDIUM PRIORITY** 
**Impact**: Development Experience and Analysis
**Python Location**: `hypothesis/internal/observability.py`
**Status**: ❌ **BASIC LOGGING ONLY**

**Missing Observability Features**:
```python
# Comprehensive test execution analysis
@dataclass
class Observation:
    type: str
    payload: dict[str, Any]
    
def collect_test_statistics(data: ConjectureData) -> dict
def export_choice_sequences_json(choices: list) -> str
```

### 7. CONSTRAINT OPTIMIZATION & POOLING - **LOW PRIORITY**
**Impact**: Memory Performance
**Python Location**: `hypothesis/internal/conjecture/data.py` (Lines 150-152)
**Status**: ❌ **NO OPTIMIZATION**

**Missing Performance Features**:
```python
# Memory optimization through constraint pooling
POOLED_CONSTRAINTS_CACHE: LRUCache = LRU(4096)
```

## Conclusion

The remaining 10% represents sophisticated, battle-tested algorithms that transform basic property-based testing into Python Hypothesis's world-class testing framework. With our solid foundation of perfect choice system parity, systematic implementation of these components will achieve complete Python functionality parity while potentially exceeding Python's performance through Rust's zero-cost abstractions.

The roadmap prioritizes core architectural components (spans) first, followed by advanced algorithms (shrinking), then optimization features (targeting), ensuring a stable foundation for each subsequent layer.
