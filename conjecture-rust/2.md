# Second Brain - SUBTASK 2: Target Observations & Coverage System

## SUBTASK ASSIGNMENT
**Implement target observations and coverage system for the remaining 3% functionality. Add directed property-based testing, structural coverage tracking, and observation-guided generation with coverage-based fitness evaluation.**

## CONTEXT ANALYSIS

Based on the context files:

### Current Implementation Status (90% Complete)
From DevJournal.md - Current status is 90% Python Hypothesis functionality with only 10% remaining:
- ✅ Core Choice System (Phase 1): Complete
- ✅ ConjectureData & TestData (Phase 2): Complete 
- ✅ Choice-Aware Shrinking (Phase 3): Complete
- ✅ Span System: Complete
- ✅ ConjectureRunner: Complete
- ✅ Provider System: Complete
- ✅ DataTree System (Phase 4): Complete

### Missing Functionality (10% Remaining)
From Python_Parity_Gap_Analysis.md:
1. **Target Observations & Coverage-Guided Testing** (3% - THIS IS MY ASSIGNMENT)
2. Advanced Shrinking Passes (5%)
3. Status System Enhancement (2%)

### Target Observations Requirements from Analysis
From Python_Parity_Gap_Analysis.md lines 75-99:

**Missing Targeting Components**:
```python
# Target observation system
TargetObservations = dict[str, Union[int, float]]
class ParetoOptimiser:
    """Multi-objective optimization for targeting"""
    def consider(self, data: ConjectureData) -> bool
    def pareto_front() -> list[ConjectureResult]

# Structural coverage system  
class StructuralCoverageTag:
    """Tracks code coverage for test generation guidance"""
    def __init__(self, label: int)
```

**Rust Implementation Needed**:
- Target observation recording during test execution
- Pareto frontier management for multi-objective optimization
- Structural coverage tag system
- Coverage-guided generation bias

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### 1. Target Observation System
- Implement `TargetObservations` as HashMap<String, f64>
- Add target recording methods to ConjectureData
- Integrate with existing events system

### 2. Pareto Optimization System
- Implement `ParetoOptimizer` for multi-objective optimization
- Track Pareto frontier of solutions
- Support for multiple optimization objectives

### 3. Structural Coverage System
- Implement `StructuralCoverageTag` for coverage tracking
- Add coverage tracking to ConjectureData
- Integrate with existing span system

### 4. Coverage-Guided Generation
- Enhance Provider system with coverage-based bias
- Implement fitness evaluation based on coverage
- Add directed generation toward uncovered areas

### 5. Directed Property-Based Testing
- Integrate all components into ConjectureRunner
- Add targeting phases to test execution
- Implement coverage-guided test generation

## FILES TO IMPLEMENT

### Core Files:
- `src/targeting.rs` - Target observation and Pareto optimization
- `src/coverage.rs` - Structural coverage tracking
- `src/directed_testing.rs` - Directed property-based testing framework

### Integration Points:
- Enhance `src/data.rs` - Add target/coverage recording methods
- Enhance `src/engine.rs` - Add targeting phases
- Enhance `src/providers.rs` - Add coverage-guided generation

### Tests:
- `src/targeting_tests.rs` - Target observation and Pareto tests
- `src/coverage_tests.rs` - Coverage tracking tests
- `src/directed_testing_tests.rs` - End-to-end directed testing tests

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. ✅ Target observations can be recorded during test execution
2. ✅ Pareto optimization maintains frontier of solutions
3. ✅ Structural coverage tracks code/branch coverage
4. ✅ Coverage-guided generation biases toward uncovered areas
5. ✅ Directed property-based testing framework operational
6. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
7. ✅ Perfect integration with existing 90% implementation

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

- **BE ABSOLUTELY SURE** to implement completely and correctly
- Follow existing patterns from the 90% complete codebase
- Maintain Python parity where applicable
- Use comprehensive TDD methodology
- Ensure zero regressions to existing functionality
- Clean integration with existing Observer and Provider systems

## PROGRESS TRACKING

Will track implementation progress through TodoWrite system and update this file as work progresses.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

This represents the final 3% of Python Hypothesis functionality needed to achieve complete parity. The existing 90% provides a solid foundation with DataTree, Provider system, and Observer patterns ready for integration.
