# Python Parity Implementation: ConjectureData Draw Operations

## Summary

Successfully ported Python Hypothesis's sophisticated ConjectureData draw operations to idiomatic Rust with full Python parity. This implementation provides the core foundation for property-based testing with advanced constraint validation, choice recording, and provider integration.

## Implementation Overview

### 1. Core Draw Operations

Implemented all five core draw methods with full Python compatibility:

#### `draw_integer()`
- **Range Support**: Unbounded, semi-bounded, and bounded integer ranges
- **Weighted Sampling**: Supports weighted value selection with proper validation (weight sum ‚â§ 1.0)
- **Shrink Direction**: Zigzag ordering around `shrink_towards` for optimal shrinking
- **Constraint Validation**: Comprehensive range and weight validation following Python rules

#### `draw_boolean()`
- **Probability-based Generation**: Configurable probability with deterministic edge cases
- **Edge Case Handling**: Special handling for p=0.0 (always false) and p=1.0 (always true)
- **Validation**: Proper probability range validation [0.0, 1.0]

#### `draw_float()`
- **IEEE 754 Compliance**: Full support for NaN, infinity, and subnormal values
- **Constraint Clamping**: Python-equivalent value clamping within bounds
- **Magnitude Constraints**: Support for `smallest_nonzero_magnitude` parameter
- **Range Validation**: Comprehensive boundary checking with NaN detection

#### `draw_string()`
- **Unicode Intervals**: Full Unicode character range support via IntervalSet
- **Length Constraints**: Configurable minimum and maximum string lengths
- **Character Validation**: Ensures all characters fall within allowed intervals
- **Collection Indexing**: Efficient character selection and ordering

#### `draw_bytes()`
- **Variable Length**: Configurable size ranges for byte sequences
- **256-byte Alphabet**: Full byte value range [0, 255]
- **Length Validation**: Proper size constraint enforcement

### 2. Choice Recording and Replay System

#### Choice Node Structure
- **Type-safe Choices**: Strongly-typed choice values with constraint metadata
- **Forced Value Tracking**: Records whether values were forced or generated
- **Serializable**: Full serde support for choice persistence and replay

#### Replay Mechanism
- **Prefix Replay**: Supports deterministic replay from choice sequences
- **Constraint Compatibility**: Validates replayed choices against current constraints
- **Misalignment Detection**: Tracks and reports replay misalignments
- **Fallback Generation**: Gracefully falls back to new generation when replay fails

### 3. Constraint Validation System

#### Python-equivalent Validation
- **Range Checking**: Comprehensive min/max validation for all types
- **Type Validation**: Ensures value types match constraint expectations
- **Edge Case Handling**: Proper handling of infinity, NaN, and boundary values
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages for constraint violations

#### Constraint Types
```rust
pub struct IntegerConstraints {
    pub min_value: Option<i128>,
    pub max_value: Option<i128>,
    pub weights: Option<HashMap<i128, f64>>,
    pub shrink_towards: Option<i128>,
}

pub struct FloatConstraints {
    pub min_value: f64,
    pub max_value: f64,
    pub allow_nan: bool,
    pub smallest_nonzero_magnitude: Option<f64>,
}

pub struct BooleanConstraints {
    pub p: f64, // Probability of True
}

pub struct StringConstraints {
    pub intervals: IntervalSet,
    pub min_size: usize,
    pub max_size: usize,
}

pub struct BytesConstraints {
    pub min_size: usize,
    pub max_size: usize,
}
```

### 4. Provider Integration

#### Provider Interface
- **Abstraction Layer**: Clean separation between generation logic and implementation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error conversion from ProviderError to DrawError
- **Fallback Support**: Internal RNG fallback when no provider is available

#### Provider Methods
```rust
trait PrimitiveProvider {
    fn draw_integer(&mut self, constraints: &IntegerConstraints) -> Result<i128, ProviderError>;
    fn draw_boolean(&mut self, p: f64) -> Result<bool, ProviderError>;
    fn draw_float(&mut self, constraints: &FloatConstraints) -> Result<f64, ProviderError>;
    fn draw_string(&mut self, intervals: &IntervalSet, min_size: usize, max_size: usize) -> Result<String, ProviderError>;
    fn draw_bytes(&mut self, min_size: usize, max_size: usize) -> Result<Vec<u8>, ProviderError>;
}
```

### 5. Legacy Compatibility

Maintained full backward compatibility with existing API:

```rust
// Legacy methods that delegate to new implementation
pub fn draw_integer_simple(&mut self, min_value: i128, max_value: i128) -> Result<i128, DrawError>
pub fn draw_float_simple(&mut self) -> Result<f64, DrawError>
pub fn draw_string_simple(&mut self, alphabet: &str, min_size: usize, max_size: usize) -> Result<String, DrawError>
pub fn draw_bytes_simple(&mut self, size: usize) -> Result<Vec<u8>, DrawError>
```
