## Key Takeaways from Swift-Hypothesis Branch Analysis

### Critical Dependency Insight
- **Crypto Dependencies**: The swift-hypothesis branch replaced `crypto-hash` with pure Rust `sha1 = "0.10"` crate
- **Reason**: Eliminates OpenSSL dependencies that cause cross-compilation issues for Apple platforms (tvOS, watchOS, visionOS)
- **Impact**: Pure Rust crypto enables reliable cross-compilation without external system dependencies
- **Implementation**: Simple replacement in database.rs:
  ```rust
  // OLD: crypto_hash::{hex_digest, Algorithm}
  // NEW: sha1::{Sha1, Digest}
  use sha1::{Sha1, Digest};
  
  fn sha1_hex_digest(data: &[u8]) -> String {
      let mut hasher = Sha1::new();
      hasher.update(data);
      format!("{:x}", hasher.finalize())
  }
  ```

### Architecture Observations
- **Draw Tracking**: Explicit `start_draw()/stop_draw()` calls are critical for proper shrinking context
- **Caching Strategy**: Engine uses execution caching (10k limit) to prevent redundant test execution during shrinking
- **Shrinking Debug**: Extensive debug printing throughout shrinking process for visibility
- **Boolean Generation**: Uses 63-bit precision for boolean decisions to match Python's approach
- **Array Shrinking**: Sophisticated array length shrinking that identifies continuation patterns

### Project Mission

This is a complete rewrite of the Rust conjecture engine, designed to faithfully port Python Hypothesis's modern conjecture architecture to Rust. Unlike the previous `conjecture-rust` implementation which was based on an older design, this version will match Python's current sophisticated architecture as closely as possible.

## Core Architectural Differences

**Current conjecture-rust (byte-based):**
```rust
pub fn bits(&mut self, n_bits: u64) -> Result<u64, FailedDraw>
pub fn draw_boolean(&mut self, p: f64) -> Result<bool, FailedDraw>
```

**Target Python-style (choice-based):**
```python
def draw_integer(min_value=0, max_value=None, ...)
def draw_boolean(p=0.5, forced=None, ...)
def draw_bytes(size, ...)
```

The rewrite moves from Python's legacy byte-stream approach to the modern choice-aware system where every draw is a typed choice with constraints.

## Why This Rewrite is Needed

### Problems with Current Implementation
- **Outdated Architecture**: Based on Python's pre-2019 byte-stream design, missing modern improvements
- **Limited Shrinking**: Cannot leverage choice-aware shrinking for better minimization
- **Ruby Integration Issues**: FFI complications and performance bottlenecks
- **Cross-Platform Limitations**: OpenSSL dependencies prevent reliable cross-compilation
- **Maintenance Burden**: Divergent codebase makes it hard to keep up with Python improvements

### Benefits of New Architecture  
- **Better Shrinking**: Choice-aware shrinking produces smaller, more meaningful examples
- **Type Safety**: Rust's type system enforces correctness at compile time
- **Performance**: Native Rust performance without FFI overhead for core operations
- **Cross-Platform**: Pure Rust dependencies enable compilation to any target
- **Maintainability**: Architecture closely matches Python, making updates easier

- **Engine**: `hypothesis/internal/conjecture/engine.py` - ConjectureRunner main loop  
- **Shrinking**: `hypothesis/internal/conjecture/shrinker.py` - Choice-aware shrinking

## API Design Principles

### Test-Driven Development Workflow
1. **RED**: Write failing tests first (port from Python + write additional)
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **REPEAT**: Cycle through RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for each feature

### Rust Idioms to Follow
- **Error Handling**: Use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations, avoid panics in library code
- **Ownership**: Prefer owned data structures, use borrowing for read-only access
- **Iterator Chains**: Leverage Rust's iterator patterns for data processing
- **Type Safety**: Use newtypes and enums to prevent invalid states
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Design APIs that compile to efficient machine code

### Performance Targets
- **Memory**: Choice sequences should use arena allocation for cache locality
- **Execution**: Core choice operations should be inline-able and branch-predictable
- **Shrinking**: Avoid redundant constraint validation during shrinking passes
- **FFI**: Minimize Ruby ↔ Rust transitions, batch operations when possible

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Ruby FFI Complexity**
   - *Risk*: Rutie integration becomes unwieldy or unstable
   - *Mitigation*: Start with minimal FFI surface, expand incrementally
   
2. **Performance Regression**
   - *Risk*: New architecture is slower than current implementation
   - *Mitigation*: Early benchmarking, profile-guided optimization
   
3. **Choice System Complexity**
   - *Risk*: Over-engineering leads to unmaintainable code
   - *Mitigation*: Start simple, add complexity only when needed

4. **Shrinking Quality**
   - *Risk*: New shrinker produces worse examples than current implementation
   - *Mitigation*: Port proven algorithms first, optimize later

### Medium-Risk Areas
- **Cross-Platform Builds**: Test early and often on target platforms
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor allocation patterns, especially for large test runs
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependency tree minimal and well-audited

### Testing Strategy
*Document testing approach and coverage*

**🚨 TDD IS PARAMOUNT**: Test-Driven Development is the core methodology for this project

**Phase 1 Testing Priority:**
1. **Port Python Tests**: Copy ALL relevant tests from `hypothesis-python/tests/conjecture/`
2. **Write Additional Tests**: Expand test coverage beyond Python's test suite
3. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing tests first, then implement to make them pass
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every choice type, constraint, and edge case must be tested

**Test Categories:**
- **Unit Tests**: Each choice type and constraint validation (COPY FROM PYTHON)
- **Integration Tests**: Choice sequences and replay functionality  
- **Parity Tests**: Compare results with Python Hypothesis on same inputs
- **Ruby Integration Tests**: FFI layer and strategy compatibility
- **Property Tests**: Use Hypothesis to test the implementation itself
- **Benchmark Tests**: Performance regression detection
- **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions, overflow, underflow scenarios
